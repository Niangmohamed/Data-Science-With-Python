# Introduction to Data Science With Python

**Author: Mohamed NIANG, ML Scientist**

## Presentation

<p align="justify"> This repository contains notebooks on introduction to data science with Python. In this course, we will discuss the Python libraries particularly used in Data Science: Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib. We will successively review Numpy objects and Pandas objects to analyze real-world data. We will also learn how to choose the right type of graph to visualize the desired data. We will have the opportunity to apply the practice through several datasets.</p>
